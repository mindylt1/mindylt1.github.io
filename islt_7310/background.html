<p class="heading3">August 2018-present--Department of Defense Education Activity-Heroes Elementary School <br>
Advanced Academics Programs and Services Resource Teacher (AAPS-RT)</p>
 
<p>As the AAPS-RT at my elementary school, I am responsible for making sure that the varying advanced academic needs of our students are met and that all aspects of our Advanced Academics program is implemented in accordance with district policies. I provide both direct and indirect services to students in grades K-5, in addition to consultation, training, and resources for my fellow staff members. My biggest success thus far has been transitioning our school to an entirely new model for providing gifted services, to include adding universal screening via CogAT testing, expansion of our program into primary grades, and restructuring the way we deliver enrichment services. My goal for next year is to continue building on last year’s success by providing more training and increasing school-wide buy-in in order to build a more inclusive program.</p>

<br>
School Leadership Team Member</p>
 
<p>The School Leadership Team (SLT) is responsible for analyzing school-wide data trends, identifying areas of growth, and planning for continuous school improvement.  The Team is also the primary point of contact for the school accreditation process.  During my time as a SLT member, I led a variety of staff development sessions and facilitated both accreditation and data analysis  committees.  I was also a member of the presentation team during our school’s most recent school-level accreditation visit. I will be rejoining our SLT in the upcoming 2020-20 school year, where we are already planning for ways to improve our school’s methods of progress monitoring and to revamp our PBIS program.

2009-2018 Department of Defense Education Activity-Heroes Elementary and Ramstein Elementary Schools
<br>
Classroom Teacher, Grades 3, 4, 5 </p>
 
<p>As a classroom teacher, I planned and delivered engaging, differentiated, standards-based instruction for classes of up to 30 elementary school aged students.  I was responsible for regular, ongoing, formative and summative assessment and for using the data collected to plan appropriate interventions for my students.  Additionally, I was responsible for building home/school relationships for meeting my students’ affective needs--a particular concern among our military population. My time as a general education teacher was a continuous learning experience, and I feel like every year taught me something different.  An enduring lesson I learned, which I have carried with me since, is that relationships are everything; students must feel safe and cared for before they can achieve their academic potential.
