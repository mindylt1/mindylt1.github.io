 <p>Hello! Welcome to my space, where I share a bit about who I am as a teacher, a learner, and an education professional.</p> 
 
<p>I have been in the field of education for over 15 years, working with students ranging from preschoolers to middle schoolers. Since 2009, I have had the privilege of teaching for the Department of Defense, serving the families of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, on bases both overseas and stateside. I have been a military spouse for 28 years and am the proud mother of three adult daughters. I love reading, traveling, exploring new restaurants, and finding new hiking spots.</p>
