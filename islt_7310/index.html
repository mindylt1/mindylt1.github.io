 <p class="overview">Hello! Welcome to my space, where I share a bit about who I am as a teacher, a learner, and an education professional.</p> 
 
<p class="overview">I have been in the field of education for over 15 years, working with students ranging from preschoolers to middle schoolers. Since 2009, I have had the privilege of teaching for the Department of Defense, serving the families of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, on bases both overseas and stateside. I have been a military spouse for 28 years and am the proud mother of three adult daughters. I love reading, traveling, exploring new restaurants, and finding new hiking spots.</p> 
<br> 

<h3 class="heading3"><strong>Experience Overview</strong></h3>

<p class="overview">Prior to completing the coursework for  teacher licensure, I spent two years as a preschool teacher in a private school setting, as well as two and a half years as an AVID tutor and program assistant in a middle school AVID program.  Since earning my teaching certifications in 2009, I have worked as both a general education teacher and as a gifted specialist in a PK-5 elementary school.</p>
