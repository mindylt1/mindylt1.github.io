Hi everyone! I’m Mindy Thompson.  I am currently a K-5 advanced academics teacher for the Department of Defense (DoDEA) aboard Camp Lejeune, NC.  Before this class, using Google Sites with my students was pretty much the extent of my web development experience (so not much!), but I’m hoping to master enough HTML basics to teach my students to code and create their own websites. 

In my personal life, I  am married and have three adult daughters. After living in Europe for many years, we became addicted to travel, so we try to plan trips whenever we can.  We also live a few miles from the beautiful NC coast, so we love to spend summers on our boat or on the beach. 

I am in my first term, working on my EdS in Instructional Technology and Design with a focus on Technology in schools, so I have a ways to go in this program.  My larger goal is to become more tech savvy for my students and to add an Educational Technologist certification to my teaching license.
